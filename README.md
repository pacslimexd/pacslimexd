I am Diego Ángel, and my fascination lies not just in electronics, but in **knowledge itself**. My passions—philosophy, literature, and the art of dialogue—form the foundation of my engineering approach.

I believe that everything carries a **story**. Art provides the clarity to see the narratives behind systems, and engineering provides the discipline to tell that story with **integrity and purpose**. My dream is that every project I create does exactly this: Tell a good story.
